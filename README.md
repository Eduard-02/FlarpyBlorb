#FlarpyBlorb

A Unity-based 2D game inspired by Flappy Bird — my first solo game development project.

Project Overview

FlarpyBlorb is a minimalist side-scrolling game built in Unity, replicating the core mechanics of the iconic mobile game Flappy Bird. This project served as my introduction to game development, where I handled the design, coding, and implementation of gameplay features using C#.

Key Features
	•	Physics-Based Gameplay: Implemented responsive player controls using Unity’s Rigidbody2D and collision detection systems.
	•	Obstacle Generation: Developed a procedural system to spawn obstacles at varying intervals and positions, enhancing replayability.
	•	Score Tracking: Created a scoring mechanism that increments as the player successfully navigates through obstacles.
	•	Game State Management: Managed game states (start, play, game over) to control game flow and user experience.

Technologies Used
	•	Engine: Unity (2D)
	•	Language: C#
	•	Version Control: Git

Project Structure
	•	Assets/: Contains all game assets including scripts, sprites, and scenes.
	•	Packages/: Unity package dependencies.
	•	ProjectSettings/: Configuration files for the Unity project.

Getting Started

To run the game locally:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Eduard-02/FlarpyBlorb.git


	2.	Open in Unity:
	•	Launch Unity Hub.
	•	Click on “Add” and select the cloned project folder.
	•	Open the project.
	3.	Play the Game:
